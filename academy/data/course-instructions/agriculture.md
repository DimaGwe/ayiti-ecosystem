## Course Overview
This course teaches sustainable farming practices adapted for Haiti's climate and conditions.

## Modules
1. **Soil Preparation** - Testing soil, composting, preparing beds
2. **Crop Selection** - Choosing crops for local climate, seasons, market demand
3. **Irrigation Systems** - Water management, drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting
4. **Pest Control** - Organic methods, integrated pest management
5. **Harvest & Storage** - Timing harvest, post-harvest handling, storage techniques

## Key Concepts to Emphasize
- Haiti's unique growing conditions (tropical climate, mountainous terrain)
- Importance of soil conservation to prevent erosion
- Water scarcity challenges and solutions
- Organic/sustainable methods that don't require expensive inputs
- Crops with good local market demand

## Common Crops in Haiti
- Vegetables: tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, cabbage, carrots

- Access to inputs like fertilizer can be limited
- Water availability varies by region and season
- Erosion is a major concern in mountainous areas
- Markets are often local; transport can be challenging
